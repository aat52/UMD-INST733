By this point in the semester, you should have formed your project team/pair. You also should be close to deciding your project topic, if you have not already done so. The immediate next step is to write and submit a formal proposal introducing your project idea. The proposal will serve as an agreement between the team and the instructors on the project topic and the scope. The following guidelines will help you complete this first project task successfully.

**What to include in the proposal?**
The proposal should include the following sections at a minimum; (you may include other relevant information, if you choose to do so):

Introduction: Present your idea/topic in a paragraph or two. The introduction should do a good job of convincing the reader that the topic is interesting, useful, and worthy of building a database based on it.
Target audience: Who would use this database? In what way(s), and to attain what goal(s)?
Questions that the database will be able to answer: This list is a very important part of your proposal, since it will drive several of the design decisions as you build your database. Your database should be designed so that it can be queried to answer the questions you expect that will be posed against it. List as many questions as possible that can be answered querying the data you will have in your database. This list will be useful in two critical stages in the project: i) when you are finalizing the list of entities to include in the database and the entities to exclude from the database, and ii) when you are developing your sample queries that will showcase the capabilities of your database. Try to think of a good variety of question, rather than listing simple variations of the same few questions. You may want to include questions that include a variety of different question words such as “who”, “what”, “which”, “when”, “how many”, “how much”. Also, think of questions, the answers to which would be a list, an aggregate number (such as a sum, a count, an average, a minimum, a maximum, etc.), a single record in its entirety, a single field in its entirety, a single cell, a number of cells from one record, a number of cells from one field, etc. This way of thinking should help you identify a good variety of interesting and reasonably challenging questions to answer by querying your database.
Potential entities/tables with potential attributes/columns: List the entities you observe in the topic domain, which you are planning to include in the database. For each entity/table, list the potential attributes. Keep in mind that these entity and attribute lists are first-cut lists, which may (and most probably will) change as you work on the project. You will not be required to include these and only these tables and columns in your database as you build it. So, think, decide, and report freely, keeping in mind that these lists may change later in the semester.
Entities/tables you will not include in the database: List at least some examples of entities/tables from the topic domain that you are not planning to include in the database. This will help you think about and communicate the scope of your project more effectively. Once again, this will not be a permanent list, and you may decide to include some of these entities in your design later in the project.
Sample data: What is your plan for obtaining real sample data, if you are working on a database that will hold real data? What is your plan for building hypothetical sample data, if you are working on a database that will hold hypothetical data? Be as detailed and thorough with your plans as possible, since adding sample data to your database will be a critical step in the project.
**How to format the proposal?**

Type your proposal in a document using 12-point Times or a similar font with 1-inch margins. Submit the word-processed document as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) (preferred) or MS Word (.doc, .docx) file.
Length restriction: This report should be 4-7 pages including any tables or diagrams. You can use additional pages for non-table and non-diagram figures/images.

**How to submit to the proposal?**
The project proposal must be submitted through the appropriate link on Canvas. Please do not email your proposal to the instructors. Email submissions will not be accepted. If you experience problems using Canvas for proposal submission, contact the instructors to receive help. Only one member from each team/pair should submit a copy of the proposal. It is OK to submit revised, updated versions of the proposal until the deadline, but all submissions must come from the same team/pair member to avoid confusion.

**What to do if you have questions or concerns?**
If you have any questions or concerns regarding the proposal development process or some aspect of your own project idea and proposal, contact the instructors immediately to seek advice and feedback.


### Score: 96/100
### Feedback: 
Topic Choice: 10/10 
Introduction: 10/10 
Target Audience: 10/10 
Questions: 8/10 (When coming up with questions that your queries will be answering please take into account what information you have available. For example, one of your questions uses location information, however, the entities and attributes that you have listed do not contain any location information, therefore I am confused as to how you will be using queries to answer that question. Also, your potential entities and attributes do not include any information regarding episodes, how are you planning on answering questions regarding how many times an outfit was worn and which episodes they appeared in?) 
Potential Entities/Tables: 18/20 (Based on the questions you are planning on asking, there seems to be some missing data such as episodes, and location data. Also, please keep in mind that for your final submission, you will be required to have 10 tables so please do not forget to expand on this. We will be expecting 10 tables for your ERD)
