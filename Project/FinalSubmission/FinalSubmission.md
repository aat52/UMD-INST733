Sample Data: 20/20 

Queries/Views: 12/20 (On your table indicating which queries satisfy which requirements, the table indicated that query 7 satisfies the requirement for filtering, however, looking at your query 7, you did not filter anything. The requirement was to have at least 3 queries that filtered and since you only have 2 you will lose 4 points for not fulfilling the requirement. Similarly, your table indicates that query 8 fulfills the subquery requirement, however, looking at your query 8, there is no subquery that is implemented in your query 8 or any other queries. As the requirement E was to have at least 1 query with a subquery, you will lose 4 points for not fulfilling that requirement.)
