## Project Overview
To develop applied skills around the topics covered in INST733, pairs of students will work a semester-long team project. The project pairs will develop a logical design for a small-scale, non-trivial relational database, and subsequently implement the design in a physical database. Once the logical and physical design phases are completed, students will populate their databases with sample data and run CRUD operations on their databases.

Pairs will choose their topics in consultation with the instructors. Project work will begin only after the topic, the scope and other particulars of the project are fully and explicitly approved by the instructors. Students will submit the project deliverables via Canvas (ELMS) for review and grading. Instructorsâ€™ feedback and grades will be posted on Canvas, as well.

There will be three major project deliverables:
1) Proposal (submitted about 1/3 into the semester, graded separately)
2) Progress report (submitted about 2/3 into the semester, not graded separately)
3) Final database and report (submitted and graded at about the end of the semester)

The following aspects of project work will be the basis for assessment:
- Logical design (including an E-R diagram, and normalization as necessary),
- Physical design (including data type choices and queries for building the physical database),
- Sample data and CRUD operations.
- Feasibility analysis of implementing the database on an alternative platform/paradigm.
- Project diary and report (Students will keep a log/diary of their activities on the database, including the challenges faced and how they were solved. The final report will summarize the overall project. The log/diary will be included in the report as an appendix section).
The database and the report will be of professional quality, in the sense that they could be used as the basis for an actual, small-scale relational database in an actual organization.

Pairs will be self-formed by Monday, February 14.  Students who do not form a team by that date will be assigned to a team by the instructors.

[Here](TopicAreas.md) is the list of possible topic areas. While it is not a strict requirement, students are encouraged to stay within the ranges of topics stated on that list. Each team will determine the scope of their database within their topic domain consulting with the instructors. The scope for each project will be reviewed and approved via the Project Proposal. 

The team project will involve the three phases listed below, each with specific deliverables. All deliverables must follow these conventions: [Team Project Deliverable Expectations](DeliverableExpectations.md).

1) Choosing and articulating an information domain, for which the team will develop a database. [Deliverable: Project Proposal]

2) Conceptually analyzing the domain and building a logical design for the database through entity-relationship modeling and normalization. [Deliverable: Progress Report]

3) Developing a physical database based on the given logical design, and compiling a project report [Deliverable: Project Database and Report Submission] comprised of:

a) A physical database that implements the logical design for the database. 
b) Real or hypothetical data that meets specified level of data quality. 
c) Queries, views, and other database schema objects that will showcase the capabilities of the database.
d) Feasibility analysis of implementing the database on an alternative platform/paradigm.
e) A report covering the overall database development process: the challenges faced, the solutions developed for those challenges, the lessons learned, the strengths and limitations of the database, possible future improvements, and other important aspects of the project and the database.
