## Project Deliverable Expectations
The team project requires you to submit several reports. Every submitted document must follow these expectations:

- Header (course number & name, section number, deliverable name and date, team number or name, full name of each team member) [NOTE: The header should only appear on the first page of each deliverable.]
- Footer (team number or name, deliverable name, page number) [Should appear on every page of each deliverable.]
- Submit as PDF, check that the printout is within printable margins, do not restrict copying and printing the document
- 12 point Times New Roman; 1.5 line spacing; 1" margins on all sides
- Within the specified page range for the given assignment
- Do not repeat the questions verbatim within the document; write the submission as a narrative
- Structure deliverables in a readable manner: use section and sub-section headings as appropriate, use bulleted lists and tables when they help convey information more efficiently.
- All code snippets in plain text, not an image (so that we can copy and paste and run your code when needed)
- References (separate section in the pdf. does not count toward the page requirement)
  - ALL sources used must be appropriately cited. 
  - Simply listing the URL is NOT a citation.
  - There is no required number of sources.
  - May use the citation style of your choice (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.)
  - Purdue Online Writing Lab ([Purdue OWL](https://owl.purdue.edu/)) is a useful tool for creating proper [citations](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/resources.html). 

NOTE: Make sure to spell check and grammar check reports. Delivered reports should be in final condition; drafts are not final. You should be producing and submitting a document that you would be proud to present to a prospective employer.
