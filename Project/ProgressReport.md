## Draft Project ERD and Progress Report

Please use this link to submit your draft project ERD and a brief progress report by the due date specified below.

The purpose of this submission is to inform the instructors about your progress on the project, and allow them to give you some first-cut feedback on your project ERD and pace of progress.

Draft ERDs and progress reports are not graded. The ERDs are not expected to be perfect, or even complete. However, the more complete an ERD is, the better, to allow for more comprehensive feedback.

Only one submission from each team is requested.

Submit a 1-2 page progress report summarizing what you have accomplished so far, and what remains to be done to complete your work on the project.

Submit your progress report as a .pdf file (preferred) or as a .docx file.

Submit your ERD in both of the following formats:

- The .mwb file (Make sure that you attach the latest .mwb file of your ERD, and not the .bak file).
- A .pdf version of the diagram. You can use the Export feature of MySQL Workbench to save a pdf copy of your diagram; see the image below.

Feel free to contact the instructors if you have questions or concerns.
