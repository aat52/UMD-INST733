## Topic Presentation Guidelines
Use the following guidelines as you prepare for your topic presentation. Feel free to contact the instructor if you have any questions or need any clarification.

1. You must manage your time well. You will have 40 minutes for the presentation and the Q&A that will follow. You should use 25-30 minutes of that time for the presentation, and 10-15 minutes for the Q&A. Deviation from the allotted times may adversely affect your presentation grade.

2. It might be a good idea to prepare a number of questions or sub-topics that will guide your presentation. Prepare a few extra questions, in case you cover all of the main questions more quickly than you planned.

3. You may want to include some or all of the following aspects in your topic presentation:

    - Introduce the technology, paradigm, approach, etc. briefly, and make a case for why we should care about it? (Why is this an important topic to cover in this course?)

    - Present the history of how and why the topic (or the technology, paradigm, approach, etc.) has become of interest. What were the main milestones as it evolved?

    - Mention an interesting case where the given technology or approach would be useful.

    - If there are alternatives to the given technology, (or paradigm, approach, etc.), introduce those briefly, mentioning the stronger or weaker points of each alternative compared to the given technology.

    - Mention a few challenges you faced as you researched the given topic and/or a few unexpected finding that surprised you.

    - Mention your main take-away(s), or lesson(s) learned, based on your research on the given topic.

4. Your delivery of the discussion is also important. Reading from slides, rushing through the presentation, pausing too much, projecting an indifferent or defensive body language are features that might disengage the audience from the discussion.

5. You can use a PowerPoint slideshow, an online presentation tool such as Prezi, printed handouts, or some other kind of visual aid for the audience to follow your presentation. You can use the whiteboard as needed. There is no hard and fast requirement, but whatever you use, make sure that it is high-quality, (free of typos, has a good text-image balance, easy to read and follow, etc.) If you are using an online presentation, make sure that you will be able to run it as soon as your allotted time starts.

6. If you are delivering a team presentation, all of the team members must be well-prepared. This includes being prepared to deliver their part of the presentation, and being prepared to answer questions from the audience during the Q&A session.
