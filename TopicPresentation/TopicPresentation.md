## Topic Presentation and Report

**Read the following instructions carefully. Your team is expected to submit a report, in addition to your presentation slides for this assignment. Only one submission per team is expected.**

**Instructions for the Report Component**

Write a 600-1000 word report about the topic you presented. The written portion of your report should fit in 3-5 pages, but if you have figures and tables to include, you can go beyond the page limit to accommodate those elements. Only one member from each team should make a submission. Submit your report as a .docx or .pdf file. Name your file as team_x_topic.docx or team_x_topic.pdf; (for example team_13_replication.pdf). In your report, cover the following aspects about the topic:

- A brief introduction: What is the technology or the approach that you are covering; (for example, what are graph databases, or what is replication?)

- Why is this technology or approach of interest to us as individuals who are studying database technologies and design?

- What is a brief history of how this technology or approach first appeared and how it evolved?

- What are the benefits and limitations/challenges around the technology or approach? How do these compare to alternative technologies and approaches?

- Other aspects you deem relevant for inclusion in the report.

- What are some resources you would recommend to individuals who may want to learn more about this technology or approach?

**Instructions for the Presentation Component**

Check this page to confirm your presentation date and topic.

You can submit through the link on this page the visual aids you will use for your project presentation, such as a PowerPoint presentation, the link to an online presentation, pdf of handouts, etc. It is best if you submit the materials in advance of your presentation, so that they can be pre-loaded on the classroom computer.

You will need to make another submission through this link when you finalize your topic report. The due date shown on this assignment page is the latest day by which you can submit your topic report. However, feel free to submit the report before that day, if you have it ready.

The presentation portion of your grade for this assignment will be determined based on your in-class presentation according to these [guidelines](PresentationGuidelines.md) and this [rubric](PresentationRubric.pdf).
