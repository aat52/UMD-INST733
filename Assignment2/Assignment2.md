# Assignment 2

Please read the full set of instructions and make sure that you understand them all before starting working on the assignment questions. Feel free to refer to the grading rubric as needed.

Clarification on number of allowed SELECT statements: Some of the questions in this assignment may require you to use subqueries or CTEs. In answers for those questions, using multiple SELECT statements in a single answer is allowed. You should be able to answer those questions using one, two, or three additional SELECT statements. The two important things to keep in mind are to get the exact same result set asked for in the question, and not to write a query that is too complex given the task.

Clarification on Q2: The screenshot included in the Questions document above is not exactly correct, since the calculation is based on the average of the line item totals, instead of the average of the order totals. Either solution / result set will be accepted for the purposes of this assignment.

### Score 100/100

### Feedback 
Answer 1: I got a syntax error preventing the query from being run which is most likely caused due to the "IS NULL" at the end of the ORDER BY clause. (One syntax error preventing query from running -10)
**Issue Resolved*
- issue; MySQL version mismatch, points returned
