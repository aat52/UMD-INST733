# Assignment 1

Please read the full set of instructions and make sure that you understand them all before starting working on the assignment questions. Feel free to refer to the grading rubric as needed.

You are expected to use MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench to answer the questions in this assignment. You need to have the three example databases that come with the Murach textbook. If you have not restored the databases yet, you can do so using the .sql script.

Submit your assignment as a whole by the deadline stated on Canvas. If you miss the deadline, you will lose points. The following scheme applies to late submissions:

|Time|Deduction|
|---|---|
|- After the deadline, but within 3 hours of it	|10% reduction of base grade; (max grade possible is 90 of 100)|
|- More than 3 hrs. after the deadline,  but within 24 hours of it	  |20% reduction of base grade; (max grade possible is 80 of 100)|
|- More than 24 hrs. after the deadline, but within 48 hrs of it	  |40% reduction of base grade; (max grade possible is 60 of 100)|
|- More than 48 hours after the deadline	|100% reduction of base grade;  (i.e., graded as 0)|

For example, if the deadline is at 11:00PM, a submission on 11:01PM is subject to 10% reduction; a submission on 2:01PM is subject to 20%, etc. The Canvas timestamp is the time at which the submission is made. Late submissions due to technical issues with Canvas, computer crashes, power outages, etc. are still considered late submissions. To avoid such problems, submit your work well in advance of the deadline.

The assignment will remain open for 48 hours after the deadline for late submissions with grade reduction.

## Score: 100/100
